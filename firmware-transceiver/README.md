Remote Power Switch Transceiver Firmware
----------------------------------------

The Transceiver unit provides a serial link with output at RS232 or logic levels
for the Battery Management System to communicate with a monitoring PC.

The serial bit rate at both ends of the link needs to be the same as that set in
the firmware. This can be changed by recompiling the firmware. The RF baud rate
does not need to be the same as the serial baud rate.
