Remote Power Switch Tx PCB
--------------------------

This board is designed to fit into a 65mm by 130mm hand case, purchased from
Jaycar, with a 12 digit keypad. It has a microcontroller in sleep mode that
is woken up when a keypress is activated. The row and column ports are set
with rows with high-level pullup and columns set to zero so that a connection
between any row and column will result in the interrupt line being pulled low
via the diode network.

In practice the unit has survived for over 12 months
without a change of batteries.
